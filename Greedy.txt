-> Greedy solution used for optimum solutions .
-> Picking best solution .
-> problem solving technique where we make optimum choice at each stage 
    locally and achieve an optimum solution .
-> pros:
        -> good time complexity .
        -> simple and easy .
-> cons :
        -> sometimes optimum solution may not be reached .
